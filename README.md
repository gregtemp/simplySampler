# simplySampler
Simple polyphonic sampler made in pd.

Features:
-6 Voices
-Granular playback (for transposition without length change)
-Midi control

-Only pd-vanilla objects (I think?)

To do list:
-Make it work on raspberry pi
-Make install.sh file that makes it load up on start up
-Figure out how to make midi work on startup (ie: without going in the preferences)
-Check out the keyboard at the school and see what the midictl numbers are and map those to the filter envelope
-Fix the damn filter envelope
