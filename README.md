# simplySampler
Simple polyphonic sampler made in pd.

Features:
-6 Voices
-Granular playback (for transposition without length change)
-Midi control
-Record button
-Pitch bend
-Only pd-vanilla objects (I think?)
-Filter envelope sort of works.
-Keyboard at the school doesn't have anything to control filter envelope so im abandoning it (yeah that's a feature, what of it).

To do list:
-Make it work on raspberry pi
-Make install.sh file that makes it load up on start up
-Figure out how to make midi work on startup (ie: without going in the preferences) (kinda figured this out with messages to [s pd] but it's not working in with -nogui flag.
